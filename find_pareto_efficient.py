    Perform Pareto improvement on the given allocation.

    Parameters:
    - valuations (List[List[int]]): A list of lists representing the valuations of players for each item.
    - allocation (List[List[int]]): The initial allocation of resources to players.
    - transfer_amount (float): The amount of resources to transfer in each step.
    - min_transfer_amount (float): The minimum transfer amount required for a transfer to be considered.

    Returns:
    List[List[int]]: The final Pareto efficient allocation.

    Examples:
    >>> valuations = [[3, 1, 6], [6, 3, 1], [1, 6, 3]]
    >>> allocation = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
    >>> pareto_improvement(valuations, allocation, transfer_amount=0.01, min_transfer_amount=0.001)
    No! - The allocation is NOT pareto efficient
    [['0.99', '0.00', '0.00'], ['0.00', '1.00', '0.00'], ['0.01', '0.01', '1.01']]

    >>> valuations = [[10, 20, 30, 40], [40, 30, 20, 10]]
    >>> allocation = [[0, 0.7, 1, 1], [1, 0.3, 0, 0]]
    >>> pareto_improvement(valuations, allocation, transfer_amount=0.01, min_transfer_amount=0.001)
    Yes! - The allocation is pareto efficient
    Initial allocation is already Pareto efficient.
